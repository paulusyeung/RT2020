	' The current color. The ColorPicker doesn't store the color value itself; it uses
	' this property exposed by the adapter class (2nd task from teh article).
	Property Color() As System.Drawing.Color

	' The text that the adapter should display. ColorPicker sets the text to the current color
	' name or to an empty string, if the ColorPicker.TextDisplayed property is set to False.
	' (3rd task from the article)
	Property Text() As String

	' This property and event allows the ColorPicker to interrogate and control 
	' the appearance of the adapter (i.e. dropped-down, or "normal").
	' (4th task from the article)
	Property HasDropDownAppearance() As Boolean
	Event DropDownAppearanceChanged As EventHandler

	' This is the actual adapted control. We've deliberately chosen to "unhide" this aspect
	' of the adapter pattern (that is, the fact that the adaptee itself must be a Control descendant), 
	' because it simplified the implementation and seemed to be "natural" in this particular context.
	' (1st task from the article and additional services not mentioned in the article - search
	' through the code for ".Adaptee" to learn about the various way this property is used).
	ReadOnly Property Adaptee() As Control
